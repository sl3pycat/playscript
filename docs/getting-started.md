Getting Started

### The first setup
All you need to do is add a script tag pointing to the latest `ps.js` release and your good to go, everything else is handled for you till you want to handle it yourself.
```html
<html>
  <script src="../ps.min.js">
    {
      body:"hello world!"
    }
  </script>
</html>
```
